			<h1>ZACHARY METZGER</h1>
			<p>
			I am a second-semester freshman at Bob Jones University. I am majoring in computer science and minoring in business. I work as a custodian in the science annex building.

			<p>
			I enjoy video games, particularly <a href="http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Minecraft_Wiki">Minecraft</a>. I am also fond of the <a href="http://www.ssbwiki.com/">Super Smash Bros</a> series.
			Sometimes I like to read in my spare time.
